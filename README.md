# bash-backup-script
Simple bash script I use to run scheduled backups in Linux.

Usage: ./backup.sh -s SOURCE -d DEST [-t]

-s: The location of the file/directory to be backed up.
-d: The remote storage location of the files specified with the -s parameter.
-t: (Optional) Includes a date in the resulting filename (if single file) or directory.

I might expand upon this in the future.
